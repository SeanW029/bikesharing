# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis

In this analysis, I am using a raw NYC_Citibike CSV file containing shared bike usage in New York 2019.08 to apply data visualization skills using Tableau to create detailed insights on:

1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Using the visualization results, I hope to provide to the investors necessary information to help them make informed business decisions.

* Both male and female subscribers outweigh corersponding customers, while males subscribers again far outweigh female subscribers

## Summary

Keep focusing on male subscribers market and apply discounts/promotion strategies on other weekdays to attract volume; advertise on female figures using shared bikes to grow this market segment; weekends should see more potential in developing new business opportunities.
